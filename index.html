                More In Need</h1>
            <p> Though the floods that ravaged large swathes of Sunamganj have started to recede, a return to normal
                life is nothing more than a distant afterthought for survivors. Since the deluge began in mid-June,
                myriads of people have been sleeping rough on highways, with their food stock either washed away or
                destroyed. The embattled residents of Sunamganj are now looking for help to pick up the pieces of their
                shattered lives. </p>
